        -     npm run db:migrate:undo

    2.2. **Project Structure**
    The project adheres to a standard directory structure typical of a **Node.js/Express** backend project. It is organized as follows:
    - **config** - Configuration files that store settings and parameters for the database
    - **controllers** - Modules responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests, processing data, and sending appropriate responses.
    - **joiSchemas** - Schemas defined using the Joi library to validate and sanitize incoming data from requests.
    - **middlewares** - Functions that intercept and process requests before they reach the controller.
    - **models** - Representations of database tables.
    - **routes** - Definitions for the URL endpoints of API, mapping incoming requests to the appropriate controller methods.
    - **utils** - Utility functions and helper modules used throughout the application for common tasks.
    - **views** - templates for rendering dynamic HTML content in email.
    - **app.js** - The entry point of the Express application where you set up server configurations, middleware, and initialize routes.

    2.3. **Implementation Approach**
    - **Models:**
      - **Direct Mapping to Database Tables:** Each of these models corresponds directly to respective database tables, ensuring a structured and organized data storage approach.
      - **Consistent Querying Components:** These models are integral components employed consistently across the project, facilitating data querying operations.
      - **Utilization of Sequelize:** The implementation of these models is streamlined and made efficient through the use of Sequelize, a database ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool.
      - **Advantages of Sequelize:** Sequelize was chosen for its ease of query construction, simplifying the process of interacting with the database. Additionally, it offers inherent safeguards against SQL injection attacks, enhancing security.
      - **MySQL Database:** The project employs a MySQL database in conjunction with Sequelize, providing a robust and reliable backend data storage solution.

- **Search Engine**:
    - **Search Engine Selection:**  In the Wexond Browser, users have the option to choose their preferred search engine from a list of available options.
    - **Default Engine Change:**  Previously, the default search engine in Wexond Browser was DuckDuckGo. However, in our extended version, we have made Google the new default search engine.
    - **Settings Data Modification:**  To implement this change, we modified the settings data within the browser.
    - **Data Storage:**  When a project is launched, it stores settings data, cookies, and local storage information in a dedicated directory specific to each user.
    - **Directory Reading:**  Subsequently, the project exclusively reads from this user-specific directory for all its data needs.
    - **Implementation Process:**  To enact this modification, it was necessary to remove the existing settings and then rebuild the project to reflect the updated default search engine setting.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts:**
    - **Enhanced Keyboard Shortcuts:**  The extended version of Wexond Browser introduces additional keyboard shortcuts to improve the browsing experience for users.
    - **Shortcut Functions:**  These shortcuts encompass various actions such as tab navigation, opening new tabs, closing tabs, and more, enhancing efficiency and navigation for power users.
    - **Efficient Tab Management:** Users can effectively manage multiple open tabs, utilizing keyboard shortcuts or mouse interactions to switch between tabs, reorder them, and close tabs as needed.
    - **Crucial Feature:** Tab management plays a pivotal role for users who regularly work with multiple websites simultaneously.
    - **Event Creation:** To implement these keyboard shortcuts, an event was created to facilitate the shifting of tabs among open windows based on specific key presses.
    - **User-Friendly Interaction:** Users can seamlessly switch tabs by pressing the designated shortcut keys, resulting in an improved browsing experience.
    - **Menu Items Implementation:** Menu items are employed to enable the functionality discussed above. They serve as triggers for specific events when clicked by the user.
- **Proxy Support:**
    - **Incorporated Proxy:** Wexond Browser distinguishes itself by incorporating support for a Las Vegas proxy, offering users the capability to modify their IP address and location. This feature enhances online privacy and grants access to geo-restricted content.
    - **User Configuration:** Users have the option to configure proxy settings directly within the browser, enabling them to route their web traffic through the Las Vegas proxy server.
    - **Implementation with proxy-chain Package:** To implement the proxy server functionality, the proxy-chain package was utilized.
    - **Utilization of os Package:** The os package was employed to verify the contents of incoming requests and to add proxy settings selectively if the request is of the IPv4 type.
    - **Proxy Server Setup:** A proxy server was set up, listening on port 8080, with the ability to forward incoming requests to an upstream proxy server equipped with authentication.
    - **Response Handling:** The proxy server is designed to handle responses from the target server, including the implementation of error-handling mechanisms.
    - **Verbose Logging:** To facilitate debugging, the proxy server is configured to enable verbose logging, providing detailed insights into its operations.
    - **Server Instance Availability:** The proxy server instance is made accessible for further utilization within the application, ensuring flexibility and extensibility in its use.
- **Implemented separate user data and sessions for each instance:**
    - **User Data and Session Separation:** In a browser application, segregating user data and sessions for each instance ensures that each user's interactions remain isolated from one another.
    - **Independence of Instances:** Each instance or user session operates independently, maintaining its distinct set of data and settings. This independence guarantees privacy and security for users.
    - **Preventing Data Interference:** This separation mechanism effectively prevents one user's actions from affecting or accessing the data or session of another user, preserving the integrity of each user's experience.
    - **Personalized User Experience:** The approach creates a personalized and tailored experience for every individual using the application.
    - **Essential for Privacy and Security:** Such separation is essential for upholding user privacy, ensuring data integrity, and maintaining robust security measures in multi-user web applications.
    - **Unique User Directories:** To implement this functionality, a unique time-stamped directory is generated for each user.
    - **Data Handling:** When such a directory already exists, the application writes data into the existing directory. If the directory is absent, a new one is created as needed.
    - **Cookies, Local Storage, and Sessions:** This approach enables the application to manage cookies, local storage, and sessions for each user separately, enhancing user-specific functionality and data management.
